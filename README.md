## üìà Results

The model was evaluated on the imbalanced Kaggle dataset. Performance metrics:

| Metric           | Value       |
|------------------|-------------|
| Accuracy         | 99.9%       |
| Precision        | 91.0%       |
| Recall           | 83.0%       |
| F1 Score         | 86.8%       |
| ROC AUC          | 98.5%       |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to severe class imbalance, metrics like Precision, Recall, and AUC are more reliable than Accuracy.
